# DOMjudge Installation(Docker)

DOMjudge is a contest management system for programming competitions. This guide will help you set up DOMjudge using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker**: [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- **Docker Compose**: Usually included with Docker Desktop. If not, [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Installation Steps


## Architecture Overview

DOMjudge consists of several components:
- **OfficialDomjudgeDocs**:[Here](https://www.domjudge.org/docs/manual/main/overview.html) 
- **DOMserver**([link](https://hub.docker.com/r/domjudge/domserver)): The main web application that manages contests, problems, and submissions. It provides the user interface for administrators, contestants, and judges.
- **Judgehost**([link](https://hub.docker.com/r/domjudge/judgehost)): A separate service that runs the judging processes. It receives submissions from the DOMserver, executes them in a controlled environment, and returns the results.
- **Database**([link](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb)): A relational database that stores all data related to contests, users, problems, and submissions.
